# Hi, I'm Cole ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software developer and cyclist based in Canada, working remotely, leading passionate teams to build platforms that solve real-world problems. 

I care deeply about:
- Believing in people and doing what everything I can to lift them up
- Working with incredible people who also care deeply
- Solving hard problems, I'm the person usually tasked to figure out the ploblem others couldn't - This is my favourite kind of problem
- Building platforms that are truly enjoyable to use, and work on. Are efficient, reliable and ready to scale.

When not at my desk I am likely tinkering in my workshop, riding a bike, talking about bike racing or adventuring with my wife.
